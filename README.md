# A-Star-Search-Path_finding-Game
A C++ hard coded Game purely based on the principles of A star Search algorithm which helps in finding the shortest path between two nodes Say Start and End among amidst multiple blocked nodes.


Description:                                                                                                                                 AQuest is an engaging C++ based game that shows problem-solving skills as you navigate through a grid-based world filled with obstacles. Inspired by the powerful A star search algorithm, this game allow players to challenge it to find the shortest path between selected start and end nodes amidst a maze of blocked nodes.                                                                                                

Gameplay:
The game presents players with a dynamic grid-based environment, where each cell represents a node. Players can interact with the grid, selecting the start and end nodes by mouse-click or keyboard input. Additionally, they can place obstacles and block nodes by simply clicking on specific cells.
